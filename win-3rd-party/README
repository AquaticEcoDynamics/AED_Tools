This folder would typically contain :

    Win32-Debug/
    Win32-Release/
    x64-Debug/
    x64-Release/

which contain headers and libraries for some of the 3rd party libraries required
for building GLM under windows.
There is also a folder called :

    Sources/

which doesn't actually contain sources, but rather contains scripts and projects
for fetching the sources and building the binaries from them.

The build process has been tested using Visual Studio Community both versions
2017 and 2019.  Additionally, you will also need cmake and git might be useful.
cmake version 3.17.0 is required for HDF5

It probably a good idea to check that the full path to this directory does not
contain spaces in the name; that has been know to cause problems.

Building
========

Open the folder Sources and double click the fetch_source.bat file.  This will
download and unpack sources - and was working as at 31/03/2020. There is also 
some information about where they are coming from in the README.txt file in 
case it doesn't work or you want to look for newer versions.

Once the fetch has finished, open the Build folder.  There are now 2 solutions
files.  If you have a fortran compiler use all_libs.sln but if you don't then
use all_lib_nofort.sln. The nofort will build all libraries except netcdff which
is OK because GLM doesn't use it; of course, GLM does need a fortran compiler
so you will probably want to fix it anyway.

Double click the chosen sln file which should launch Visual Studio. Once it has
loaded selcet which targets you are building from the pull downs in the toolbar
then select "Build Solution" from the Build menu.
