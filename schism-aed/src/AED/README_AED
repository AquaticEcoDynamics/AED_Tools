# The aed_changes.xdiff file should be applied from the top level schism directory
#
# This diff patches :
#
#       src/Core/schism_glbl.F90
#
#       src/Hydro/schism_init.F90
#       src/Hydro/schism_step.F90
#       src/Hydro/schism_finalize.F90
#
#       cmake/SCHISM.local.build
#       src/CMakeLists.txt
#
# schism_glbl.F90 patches the number of available tracers from 12 to 13 to support AED.
# The other 3 source patches add calls so the aed for initialisation, execution, and cleanup
#
# It may be that there are more points for useful entry, these so far were drived using
# cosine and fabm as examples.
#
# Other changes to the schism source tree are made from the build_schism.sh file which patches
# cmake input files to turn on/off modules.
#
#                          -------------------------------
#
# the main AED stufff then lives in src/AED/ which has two files (for now) :
#
#            CMakeLists.txt.m   and   schism_aed.F90
#
# CMakeLists.txt.m is modified by the build script to correct the paths listed in it, writing
# the modified file to CMakeLists.txt for the cmake system to use.
#  [it turned out the gnu-make files were worse than the cmake files  a bit disappointing]
#
# schism_aed.F90 contains :
#
#   schism_aed_init_model(ntracers=ntrs(13))
#     At this stage most variables are not yet set - so we dont know, for example, how many 
#     columns there are, nor how many layers.  This is a good place to read the aed.nml file
#     to set global configuration values
#
#   schism_aed_init_stage2()
#     So now we have ne (or nea) for the number of column, and, presumably a bunch of
#     other useful bits so we can build arrays etc.
#
#   schism_aed_do()
#     The main doing stuff routine - currently doesnt seem to get called, but thats
#     kind of OK because it still needs a fair bit of work, and until the init stage
#     works properly...
#
#   schism_aed_write_output(time=time)
#     Not sure what happened to the netcdf creation, I thought I had it in there....
#
# The current iteration of this file uses the libaed-api which is the simplified
# interface to the aed libraries. Unfortunately it has had an issue where some allocated memory
# is being used beyond its bounds and breaks malloc. This is proving difficult to track down.
# To get around this issue I am currently working on a version of schism_aed that goes directly
# to the libaed stuff which is more complicated and untidy but hopefully will get us moving again.
