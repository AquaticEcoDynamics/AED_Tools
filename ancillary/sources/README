This is a start toward unifying the build process of ancillary libraries
for the various systems - currently very incomplete

This directory doent contain sources, but rather contains scripts for fetching
the sources and building the libraries from them.

It probably a good idea to check that the full path to this directory does not
contain spaces in the name; that has been know to cause problems.

Building
========

Open the folder sources and double click the fetch_source.bat file.  This will
download and unpack sources - and was working as at 31/03/2020. There is also 
some information about where they are coming from in the README.txt file in 
case it doesn't work or you want to look for newer versions.

Once the fetch has finished, open the Build folder.  There are now 2 solutions
files.  If you have a fortran compiler use all_libs.sln but if you don't then
use all_lib_nofort.sln. The nofort will build all libraries except netcdff which
is OK because GLM doesn't use it; of course, GLM does need a fortran compiler
so you will probably want to fix it anyway.

Double click the chosen sln file which should launch Visual Studio. Once it has
loaded selcet which targets you are building from the pull downs in the toolbar
then select "Build Solution" from the Build menu.

The directory Build has project files to build the libraries using
VisualStudio 2015/2017/2019 ; use all_libs.sln. They are set up to access
source files from directories in this directory called :

zlib-1.3.1
freetype-2.13.3
jpeg-9f
libpng-1.6.44
libgd-2.3.3
curl-8.11.0
szip-2.1.1
hdf5-1.14.5
netcdf-c-4.9.2
netcdf-fortran-4.6.1

This is obviously the versions of the source files used.

They are available from :
